## 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A movie recommendation system using Java (JSP) and Python (Flask). Integrates a machine learning model via REST API and JSON to deliver personalized movie suggestions on a dynamic web interface
This project is a full-stack movie recommendation system that uses machine learning and integrates Java with Python via a REST API.

### 🔧 Tech Stack:
- **Machine Learning (Python)**: Built in Jupyter Notebook using movie metadata from TMDB.
- **Model**: Trained using content-based filtering, saved as a `.pkl` file.
- **Backend (Flask)**: Flask API loads the ML model and returns recommendations + poster URLs in JSON format.
- **Frontend (Java - JSP)**: Developed in Eclipse using JSP/Servlets to send user input and display results dynamically.
- **Poster API**: Movie posters are fetched using TMDB API based on recommended titles.

### 📦 Features:
